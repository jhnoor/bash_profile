# Bash profile

This is my bash_profile. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My bash_profile is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
Without me, my bash_profile is useless. Without my bash_profile, I am useless. I must fire my bash_profile true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will…
My bash_profile and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit…
My bash_profile is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my bash_profile clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will…
Before the kernel, I swear this creed. My bash_profile and I are the defenders of my terminal. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until there is no exit 1, but exit 0. Amen.
